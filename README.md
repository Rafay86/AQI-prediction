## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on meteorological data. It utilizes web scraping techniques to gather historical meteorological data, integrates various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression for prediction, and provides a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit.

- **Data/**: Directory containing HTML data scraped from meteorological websites (`Html_Data/`) and processed CSV data (`Real-Data/`).
- **Models/**: Directory containing trained machine learning models.
- **app.py**: Main script for running the Streamlit web application.
- **requirements.txt**: File listing dependencies required to run the project.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical meteorological data obtained through web scraping. Each dataset includes features such as Temperature (T), Maximum Temperature (TM), Minimum Temperature (Tm), Sea Level Pressure (SLP), Humidity (H), Visibility (VV), Wind Speed (V), Wind Gust (VM), and PM 2.5 concentration.

## Web Scraping
The `met_data` function in Python is used to scrape meteorological data from HTML files stored locally. It extracts tabular data from specific HTML files using BeautifulSoup, cleans and processes the data, and prepares it for integration with machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning models are implemented for AQI prediction:
- **Linear Regression**: Basic linear model used for regression tasks.
- **Ridge Regression**: Linear regression with regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Lasso Regression**: Linear regression with L1 regularization for feature selection.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Ensemble model utilizing multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.

Trained models are stored in the `Models/` directory and can be used for prediction after training.

## Web Interface with Streamlit
The project includes a web interface developed using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications. Users can input parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility to obtain predicted AQI values. The interface provides a seamless way to visualize predictions and explore model performance.

## Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed. Clone the repository and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the Streamlit web application using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to the provided local address (usually `http://localhost:8501`) to access the web interface.
4. Input desired parameters and observe predicted AQI values generated by the selected machine learning model.
